# Foghorn-bot
A Discord bot made in Csharp using discord.net api used for my discord group which can be found here;
A few stuff are missing, such as the dependencies, file locations and the bot token

# API used
https://github.com/discord-net/Discord.Net
This is what i used

# What can i use this for
You can read the code, steal parts for personal projects or do what ever you like with it

# Why do you do x in this way
This bot was made as an learning experience, I used this as a way to learn Csharp, both to learn how it works, 
and how to write code more efficiently. I might come back to improve it someday, but i'd rather re-write the whole thing and 
carry over the few 'good' parts.
